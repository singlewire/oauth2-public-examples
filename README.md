# Singlewire Example App Integrations
This repository contains three simple example programs Singlewire has provided to expedite adding authentication code to your application. These programs can be used to authenticate integrations with InformaCast. The basic layout of the authorization-code-flow apps follows the conventions of the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) template.

Since we're using node and express here, it adds a little complexity to the request flow (i.e., requiring server-side API calls). Some additional information about those specifics can be found [here](https://medium.com/@madelinecorman/making-http-requests-in-node-js-16fe74af0a79).

In the simplest example, `client-credentials-flow`, we show how a simple command-line app can interact with an app created in the Administrative Console to send scenarios from an authorized external system. See that example's [readme](client-credentials-flow/README.md) for detailed instructions.

The second example, `authorization-code-flow-no-pkce`, uses an interactive interface to allow users to authorize any generic app with given scopes configured via the Administrative Console. See that example's [readme](authorization-code-flow-no-pkce/README.md) for detailed instructions.

The third example, `authorization-code-flow-with-pkce`, is the same as the previous example but requires a PKCE exchange rather than relying on stored Client_ID and Client_Secrets. This is the best practice for code that will be distributed and could be decompiled (like a native app on mobile or desktops). See that example's [readme](authorization-code-flow-with-pkce/README.md) for detailed instructions.


Each of these examples show:

- The configuration steps you need to take within the Administrative Console
- How to get an access token to interact with the InformaCast server
- How to use the access token to fetch a list of scenarios
- How to use the access token to send a scenario notification

Once you've authenticated and granted the app access via appropriate scopes, you'll have access to the full range of API access that each scope conveys. See this document for the process of creating an app via the InformaCast Administrative Console and how scopes can be granted:

## Troubleshooting

### User Denied Access
If you've followed all the instructions and you see a pop-up message that says "User Denied Access" (there should also be a corresponding 304 response from the server saying "Your InformaCast Administrator has not enabled the usage of this application." if you use a network capture to view it), that means that after you created your application in the Administrative Console, you didn't enable it. Return to the List Applications page and click the Enable button next to the app's Disabled status. This error may also be encountered by declining the permissions when the app asks.

### Invalid redirection url provided
Once the login flow completes, you are not redirected to the app; instead, an Error message appears saying "Invalid redirection URL provided." If the URL says http://localhost:8080/oauth, that means you didn't log in via the Ngrok portal (_myname_.ngrok.io). You MUST use that Ngrok redirect for these apps to authenticate correctly.

If the error specifies an ngrok URI, be sure that the redirect URI for your application includes the `/oauth` path and matches the URI specified in the error. Also, be sure that you specify the correct client ID and client secret for your app. 

## Scopes
The following scopes are allowed to be granted with one or both of read or write with write implying create, delete, and update permissions (e.g., `urn:singlewire:scenarios:read`, or `urn:singlewire:scenario-notifications:write`):

* ALARMS
* AREAS-OF-INTEREST
* BELL-SCHEDULES
* COLLABORATION-GROUPS
* CONFIRMATION-REQUESTS
* DISTRIBUTION-LISTS
* INCIDENT-PLANS
* NOTIFICATIONS
* NOTIFICATION-PROFILES
* MESSAGE-TEMPLATES
* REPORTS
* RING-LISTS
* SCENARIO-NOTIFICATIONS
* SESSION
* SITES
* SITES-ROLES
* TRACKING-EVENTS
* USERS

Refer to [this document](scopes.json) for a consumable JSON file with allowable scopes and verbs.

## Refreshing Tokens
Not covered in these example apps is the need to request renewed access and refresh tokens after users' initial logins. Generally, the flow we expect the apps to implement is consistent with a standard [access](https://oauth.net/2/access-tokens/)/[refresh](https://oauth.net/2/refresh-tokens/) token exchange when a user is actively using your application. If this refresh logic is omitted, the user will be logged out when the access token expires (usually reasonably quicklyâ€”around 5 minutes after the initial token was issued), and they will need to provide their credentials again. When implemented correctly, refreshing these tokens behind the scenes improves the user experience.

Applications should manage access tokens to check the expiration when the access token will be used to make a request, then first make a `POST` request using the refresh token to the `/api/token` endpoint with the following parameters, then store and use the newly created access token in the original request:
```code
POST /api/token HTTP/1.1
Host: https://api.icmobile.singlewire.com/api/token

grant_type=refresh_token
&refresh_token=GEbRxBN...edjnXbL
&client_id=eKNjzFFjH9A1ysYd
&client_secret=lfaldfjladNfl (optional)
```
(note the `grant_type=refresh_token`)

The response will contain both a new access token and a new refresh token, both of which should be cached or stored for use in future requests. Each _refresh token_ can only be used once. This new access token can continue to be used until it is about to expire, in which case the process may be repeated.

```code
{
  "access_token": "eyJz93a...k4laUWw",
  "refresh_token": "3877341f...511ec723",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "scope": "urn:singlewire:ring-lists:read urn:singlewire:message-templates:write",
  "expires": 3600
}
```
The expiration of those tokens is specified in the `exp` field in each token (in milliseconds from epoch, encoded in [JWT](https://jwt.io) format). As shown above, the expiration of the new access token is also returned in the `expires` field of the response. Requests made using an access token after it has expired will be denied, and refresh requests after the refresh token expires will be rejected with a 401 `bad_token` response, and the user will need to log in again to get a new refresh token. Those refresh tokens also have a finite lifespan before the user MUST log in again.

When a user logs out or wants to end a session, your app should make a DELETE request to invalidate the current refresh tokens via the `/session` api endpoint.
